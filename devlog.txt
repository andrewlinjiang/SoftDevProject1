Devlog Rules:
Devlog allows any group member at any time to see the current state of the project.
PM will make sure devlog is being maintained, but will not make all entries.
When any team member stops working and pushes changes to github, they should update the devlog explaining what changes have been made. Include errors/bugs discovered (or created).
Separate devlog entries with a newline.
Most recent entry at the bottom.
Each entry should begin with the following format: firstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.: topherM -- 1999-12-31 23:59 )

- caught everyone up on wsgi, conf files
- Attempted P0:
	- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'
		- Solved by removing utils.py and moving all relevant functions to __init__.py
	- jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: login.html
		- tried changing to absolute path
		- tried remaking the templates folder
		- tried putting login.html onto the same directory
		- stuck on this error, google-fu yielded no results, asked RC for help
		- NOTE: the simple flask app was able to access templates folder, which means.... ???
- concluded meeting

- flaskapp serves up template in question
- bruh face, we do not know why it works or why our solution does anything
- it defies all laws of logic
- oh well
